# This is the assembler phase.  This variant is only invoked during
# the second compilation where we are building bitcode.  The compiler
# has already been instructed to generate LLVM IR; the compiler then
# tries to assemble it into an object file.  The standard assembler
# doesn't understand LLVM bitcode, so we interpose and use the llvm-as
# command to build a bitcode file.  We leave the bitcode in place, but
# record its full absolute path in the corresponding object file
# (which was created in the first compilation phase by the real
# compiler).  We'll link this together at a later stage.
