This code inserts counter variables in ssa form in each basic block of a program aiming to be used for the WCET problem.

The code is mainly a LLVM pass that reads llvm bitcode and output llvm assembly language.

In the WCET solving enviroment, it is supposed to be used in this sequence:

$ instructionsWCET -i file.bc > modified_file.ll
$ llvm-as modified_file.ll -o modified_file.bc
$ pagai -i modified_file.bc

The last "CostCounter_*" variable indicates the WCET value. Currently, the value is not accurate and is just the number of instructions.
